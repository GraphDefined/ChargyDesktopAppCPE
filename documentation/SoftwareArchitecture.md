# Chargy - Transparency Software for E-Mobility Applications

## Introduction and Goals

As a driver of electric vehicles you have to tacle a couple of well-known
challenges: Where and when do I charge my vehicle and will I receive a
correct invoice for this process? To solve these issues the German Eichrecht
defines a legal foundation how to measure time and energy in a trustworthy
way, how to sign and store these measurments via digital signatures and how
to send these data to the endusers. You can think of this as a digital
receipt of the charging time, amount of consumed energy and the resulting
costs. Later in time an enduser can use a so called "transparency software"
to verify the correctness of these receipts and to prove possible mistakes.

Although the high demands of correctness and transparency in e-mobility
charging seem to be obvious, surprisingly no Open Source transparency
software was available until now. By this the goal of transparency was
actually not achieved, as even experienced endusers can not distinguish
between a wrong receipt and bugs within a closed source transparency
software. In the same way the legal situation of consumers had not been
improved significantly.


## Scope of the work

It is the legal duty of a charging station vendor and operator to provide
all the required tools to verify a receipt. Chargy is a such a tool and
helps endusers to understand the origin and composition of all expenses
independend of their desktop computer and smart phones. For special
regulatory tasks even a special Chargy Linux-Live-DVD exists.


## Approach

By using the well-known frameworks [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
and [Electron](https://electronjs.org) we created a platform independent and
Open Source transparency software. This software can process the (still) very
different data formats of different charging station providers and verify their
correctness by using cryptographic algorithms. Besides this, Chargy is the first
transparency software in the market which does not only implement the minimal
requirements of the German regulators like the Physikalisch-Technische
Bundesanstalt (PTB), but tries to put the enduser into the center of any
development. This means Chargy does not only show additional information
about charging stations, their geo coordinates, addresses, tariffs and
includes an issue tracker. This all is done to give the ev driver the best
experience, to help him evaluate the correctness of the charging process
and to support him when something seems to be wrong.

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

Constraint | Description, Background                  
-- | -- 
Support of Linux-, Mac OS X and Windows-Desktop-Operating Systems | The software must run on Windows 10+ and Mac OS X. Aditionally it must run on Linux, in order to provide Live-DVD or USB-Stick. 
Support on iOS- and Android Smart Phone-Operating Systems | The software muss run on current iOS and Android smart phones.
Frozen Versions | The cryptographic hash value of a specific version of the software is part of a legal document. Automatic updates without user interaction is not possible.
