## Contributor License Agreement

We ask each of our contributors to sign our contributor license agreement (CLA).
This has advantages for both parties, it gives you the assurance that your
contribution will remain available under the Apache 2.0 license. Meanwhile, you
give your code in license to us, so we can add your code to the Chargy Transparency
Software. And we know your contribution is entirely your work, so we don't get
in trouble with legal issues. Please read the CLA text carefully.

## Submitting code
To submit changes to the Chargy Transparency Software branches:

  request message (example: fixes #101, solved #87). If no ticket exists, create
  one beforehand. Afterwards, please update the relevant documentation.
